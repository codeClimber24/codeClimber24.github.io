          <p class="comment">I always look forward to having treatment done by Sophy. She’s always smiling and chatty and I am always left feeling happy with the treatment I receive. Her treatments are affordable, but that does not compromise the quality. I would certainly recommend her - I won’t go anywhere else to have my eyebrows shaped or my nails done!</p>

          <p class="comment">I've been using Sophy for almost 4 years now and not only gained a fab nail technician but also a great friend. She always has a great selection of colours and glitters and is only thinking of new combinations and willing to try out my Instagram/Pintrest ideas! I would always recommend her to others and I'll be going to her for many years to come!</p>
