                There is also an optional Abseil Module (often run in conjunction with Climbing Wall Instructor training and assessment courses) which is all about supervising abseiling on artificial structures.

            Training
          </h3>
          <p>
            Before you attend a Climbing Wall Instructor training course, make sure you have done the following:
            <ul>
              <li>
                You must be registered on the scheme.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            You must have an up to date logbook (preferably DLOG) with evidence of the following:
            <ul>
              <li>
                50 led routes.
              </li>

                Climbed at 3 different major climbing walls.

            Consolidation
          </h3>
          <p>
            Consolidate your experience. Candidates will generally see new ideas and techniques during training and will therefore need some time to practise and evaluate these before taking the assessment. During this period of consolidation, candidates are advised to climb at as wide a range of venues as possible, both as an individual and when assisting with the supervision of others. Mountain Training recommends that all but the most experienced candidates allow a minimum of three months between training and assessment. There is currently no time limit on the validity of a training course and some candidates may take several years to complete the qualification.

            Foundation Coach Award
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Foundation Coach Award is designed to enable coaches to be more effective in coaching the delivery of the fundamental movement skills of climbing. Foundation Coaches will usually be concerned with the stimulating delivery of a single session to a group of individuals. They will often be assisting a Development Coach who will set the learning outcomes for the session, as part of a longer term progression, course, or scheme.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get started on the Foundation Coach qualification you need to meet the following prerequisites:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Have a genuine interest in climbing and the coaching of groups on climbing walls.
              </li>
              <li>
                Have at least six months experience of climbing on a variety of climbing walls.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be at least sixteen years of age at the date of registration.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be a member of a mountaineering council (BMC, Mountaineering Ireland, Mountaineering Scotland). If you are a member of a club that is affiliated (do check) that would suffice.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you can meet all of the above requirements, here's what to do next:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create an account on our Candidate Management System or log in if you already have one.
              </li>
              <li>
                Register for the Foundation Coach scheme (this costs Â£47) - you will automatically be registered for the Development Coach scheme so that should you wish to progress at a later date, you can do so without having to register again.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>
            Training
          </h3>
          <p>

              <li>

          <h3>
            Consolidation
          </h3>
          <p>
            The period between training and assessment (often referred to as the consolidation period) varies in length for each person and is an opportunity to develop your skills, paying particular attention to any weaknesses identified during the training course. You are expected to gain extensive personal climbing as well as coaching experience during this period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practise coaching as many different types of individual and group as possible, ideally over a range of time frames and for a variety of objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The provider who delivered your training will be able to give you feedback and a personalised action plan for your consolidation period.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is currently no time limit on the validity of a training course and some candidates may take several years to complete the qualification.
          </p>

            Development Coach Award
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Development Coach Award is for independent autonomous coaches who want to prepare for, and deliver a structured progression in â€˜Climber Centred Coachingâ€™ over a series of coaching sessions.
          </p>

            The skills of the Foundation Coach will be developed to a more sophisticated level, to match their delivery to the needs of developing climbers within a group. Often working with Foundation Coaches, the Development Coach will take a mentoring role, and lead in the review process to promote reflective coaching practice.
