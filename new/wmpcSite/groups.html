					<p>
						Having had the privilege of working as a volunteer in Children's Hospices, for Helen and Douglas House in Oxfordshire and Acorns in the West Midlands I have been in awe of the courage and attitude of the siblings and families of those that have been referred to the Hospices, and those that have learnt to live alongside a sibling with a life shortening illness. These workshops are here for those who want to have some seriously good fun away from some of the anxieties and complexities of their day to day life.

								A very special Saturday afternoon, for 2 extremely special young ladies!!
							</h2>
							<p>
								Parents Steve and Emma said;  "What an awesome experience for our girls. They were put at ease immediately by Sophie and Tigs' warm welcome. It was so lovely to watch the girls totally immersed in the climbing whilst being the centre of attention. They grew so much in confidence and excitement during the session. As parents it was a real pleasure for us to watch our girls having so much fun. It is a memory we will cherish.<br />
								Izzy and Lily wanted to add;  "It made us feel very special, as the afternoon had been organised just for us. We had so much fun. It was amazing. We loved it and can't wait to climb with Sophie and Tigs again."

					  	We run groups specifically for young people making sure it fits in with their time schedule and any specific needs they may have. Freddy, pictured here with his sister and father, is the club's youth representative, and we will be seeking his guidance on how he envisages these groups developing in the future. Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for information or any personal ideas.
