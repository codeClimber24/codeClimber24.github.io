  					Climbing means everything to me! It marked the stage in my life where I gained self confidence through putting on muscle, becoming a healthy size & weight and socialising at climbing walls. It’s how I met some great lifelong friends who still mean a great deal to me. It’s how I rehabbed my body, brain and mental health after a debilitating and life changing motorbike crash over a decade ago. And once again, after using it to finally overcome the brain injury’s most crippling symptoms, it’s given me passion for life and for exercise again.<br /><br />It builds me up in so many ways. For a start you get the fantastic blend of happy hormones that accompany exercise with the rewarding brain chemical release when you conquer a problem or route. Then there are those wonderful hormones that release when you socialise and the general contentment from being a valued member in a group of peers. I feel great for sorting my life out and using it to overcome disability, I love how when I’m on the wall it’s pure enjoyment, even when it’s through strained muscles and gritted teeth. The beads or even pools of sweat remind me that I’m doing something great for my body. My brain appreciates the challenge of deciphering problematic climbs by working out the beta. And, as you will hear from many a climber, I always feel at home walking into any climbing centre in the world, although walking into new centres brings it own form of excited anticipation for exploring new climbs. Climbing rocks and thanks to climbing, I now rock too!!

  					Sophie's Testimony
  				</h2>
  				<p>
  					I love being part of such a warm, welcoming and inspiring group of people. Through the development of WMPC I have witnessed the enabling of others to explore their forgotten aspirations in a safe and nurturing environment. People have found themselves again after trauma and suffering by realising there is still so much hope by learning to practice self compassion. Slowly under our guidance they can challenge themselves physically once more and feel a huge sense of achievement. It is a true gift to be involved in someone's recovery.

  					Tigs' Testimony
  				</h2>
  				<p>
  					Having suffered with a long term chronic health condition for over 2 decades. I have tried many things to relieve me from my suffering both emotional and physical. My wife has seen me climb when it has been difficult for me to walk. When I climb my mind is so focussed on my survival and not falling that it seems impossible for my body to also tell me how much pain I am in. It is quite normal for me to climb something, and then due to my reduced mobility, have to ask someone to take my shoes off for me. It has been a very slow process for me to rebuild the muscles and mobility required for basic day to day activities and regain independence in areas of my life, a huge part of this has been thanks to climbing and the patient friends I climb with.

  					Climbing is out of this world!
  				</h2>
  				<p>
  					It is difficult to explain what it is like when climbing with Daddy and Sophie. It feels like we are in a completely different world, as we are so focused on all the things we are being taught. Even though our Daddy is disabled he is really good at teaching climbing and taking care of people. Sophie is kind and gentle and makes our extraordinary climbing adventures so much fun. Climbing has helped us over-come some of our fears. We will remember all of our climbing adventures forever. They are the only people we would want to climb with. Climbing is an amazing sport. If you haven’t done it, definitely have a go.<br />

  					Katherine's Testimony
  				</h2>
  				<p>
  					When I began climbing with WMPC I instantly felt comfortable and accepted. In the few weeks I have been climbing with them my technique and confidence has improved massively. For me, climbing allows me to forget how hard I find day to day activities that everyone seems to do with ease and relax, it has become a vital part of my routine. Everyone in the group accepts you for who you are, I can sit and listen during breaks and not be judged for not taking part in the conversation. WMPC is a truly inclusive group and I would encourage you to have a go if you aren't sure.

  					Charlotte's Testimony
  				</h2>
  				<p>
  					Over the last few years I have struggled with the diagnosis of a chronic pain condition. I found that my confidence really took a knock and I stopped doing a lot of things because I was scared of the pain it might cause me. Joining WMPC has totally changed my outlook. I have enjoyed climbing so much and it has also given me back a lot of confidence in myself and my abilities. If I am having a bad day with my pain there is no pressure to climb and I can just relax and enjoy the company (and cake!) instead. Sophie and Tigs have been the most brilliant and understanding teachers and friends. I really cannot recommend WMPC enough!

  				<h2>
  					Kam's Testimony
  				</h2>
  				<p>
  					I have a real sense of freedom and space when climbing. It makes me feel enlightened to have the strength and hope to believe the impossible is possible. It doesn’t matter if you reach the top, it is acknowledging each step is its own individual achievement. Being part of the WMPC gives me a great sense of joy and I feel privileged, to see other's smiles return as their confidence blossoms. (Image Summit of Cho-Oyu 8201 Metres)

  					Chris' Testimony
  				</h2>
  				<p>
  					When I started climbing with Tigs and Sophie at Redpoint climbing centre in Birmingham, I actually forgot I was missing a leg, as I was putting all my concentration and energy into the climb in front of me. I just used all of the new techniques and balance to work my way through the different routes we tried. It was so exciting to be doing something active again and being part of a team. I was given the opportunity of responsibility immediately through learning how to belay other climbers in the club.

  					Redpoint's Endorsement
  				</h2>
  				<p>
  					Tigs, Sophie and the WMPC are passionate about climbing and the benefits of involvement.  Redpoint are proud to be supporting the WMPC and their quest to making climbing as inclusive as possible.<br />
  					Climbing promotes team work, builds an individual's confidence and develops personal skills that can be utilised in all areas of life. It is particularly accessible for people with SEN because it is adaptable and does not require full motor function whilst enabling the climber to achieve and succeed at their own pace.<br />
  					With climbing, the challenge is personal rather than competitive. It offers the opportunity to engage with people outside of their normal day to day lives. Participants have the chance to develop new transferable skills such as problem solving, overcoming personal challenges and building trust in their peers whilst creating positive individual outcomes.

  					John's Endorsement
  				</h2>
  				<p>
  					Since taking up the sport of climbing it has taken me to places that I would never have imagined, whilst representing my country as a member of the GB Paraclimbing Team. The concentration required whilst climbing a route means that I cannot focus on anything else, so therefore I am not thinking about my disabilities and what I cannot do.  With the help of a sight guide I am able to climb the same routes as non-disabled climbers.  It is always a sense of achievement upon reaching the top of a route or boulder problem, knowing that it is 'me' that has got myself to the top.  It is such a good way of keeping fit, you get a full body and mind workout. It doesn't matter what your disability is, there is a route out there for everyone, regardless of whether you are a beginner or are returning to the sport.  I definitely recommend that you give it a go, you never know where it might take you.
