					Fig Four Workshop
				</button>
				<div class="accordion-content">
					<p>
						Fig Four was developed to simulate climbing with technical axes on ice or mixed routes. It utilises a completely different range of muscle groups and can suit individuals with poor hand mobility or damage or even loss of upper limbs. We have discussed the possibility of creating a prosthesis with a prosthetic centre to meet this requirement. Those that have taken part in the workshops so far have really enjoyed the new techniques they have learnt. Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for further information on these workshops and if they might be suitable for you.

					Trust and Self Compassion Workshop

					<div class="trust">
						<img src="images/sosaa.jpg" alt="SOSAA logo" title="SOSAA logo" />
						<p>
							This workshop was inspired by talking with John Churcher, GB Paraclimber, and initially developed for RSVP (Rape and Sexual Violence Project, Charity no. 508669) and Sosaa (Survivors of Sexual Abuse Anonymous, Charity no. 1158391) in Birmingham. Within this workshop we challenge our inner critics, that say we  could have done that better, I should be able to do this, I would have been able to achieve this ifâ€¦.<br /><br />Here we learn to listen to our bodies that we have here in this moment, without critical evaluation, concentrating on our breath and other senses and communicating with another in who we place complete trust. This can be extremely rewarding for those who are ready for this type of approach and it should not be rushed. Please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a> to discuss this workshop or either of the charities mentioned above.
